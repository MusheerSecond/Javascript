Mocha:
    -> The test files should be named with the "filename.test.js" format.(used by convention, maybe used as a different extension)
    -> No need to import mocha inside of our test file since we are going to run our test cases through mocha.(it automatically does the job)
    -> The test function looks like     
    Syntax:
        it("What i am going to do", () => {
            ...
        })
    -> we can run mocha by changing the value of "test" in the scripts property in the package.json file to "mocha **/*.test.js"    
    -> we can use "npm test" to start running our test cases.
    -> The function to test should have been exported by the module that contanins it.(don't know how to test function that is not exported)
    -> A test is considered to be PASSED if it does not throw any error.(no need to do anything else). But, in the async methods, we have to be
       calling the done method with errors(if any) to specify if the test has passed or not.
