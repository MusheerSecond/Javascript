SPY:
  -> A test spy is a function that records arguments, return value, the value of this and exception thrown (if any) for all its calls.
  -> It is just a spy, nothing more.
  -> Types:
      -> Some are anonymous functions(e.g callback function.)
      -> Some wrap methods that already exist in the system under test.


Spy on anonymous functions:
  -> When the behavior of the spied-on function is not under test, we can use an anonymous function spy. (i.e we create a spy and pass it in place of a callback)
  -> The spy wonâ€™t do anything except record information about its calls.

Using a spy to wrap an existing method:
  -> The spy will behave exactly like the original method (including when used as a constructor), but you will have access to data about all calls.
