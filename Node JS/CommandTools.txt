Command Line Arguments : 
	-> We can access this from the process object(process.argv)
	-> The process.argv is an array. It also contains some unnecessary items in the array.
	-> We can also get the values using a third party module called Yargs. This can save us some time with parsing.

Configuring Command Tools with Yargs : 

	-> Yargs has a command method that can be used to define the structure and configuration for each and every command, we might be using.
	-> This forms in as a great source of help for people new to application to start using the command arguments with correct arguments.
