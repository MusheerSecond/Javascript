JSON  -  -> JavaScript Object Notation(JSON) is a LightWeight data-interchange format.
         -> It is easy for humans to read and write. It is easy for machines to parse and generate.
         -> It is based on a subset of the JavaScript Programming Language
         -> JSON is built on two structures:
               -> A collection of name/value pairs. In various languages, this is realized as an object, record, struct, dictionary,
                  hash table, keyed list, or associative array.
               -> An ordered list of values. In most languages, this is realized as an array, vector, list, or sequence.


         Notes -
            -> Leading zeros are prohibited( in JSON.stringify zeros will be ignored, but in JSON.parse it will throw SyntaxError).
            -> A decimal point must be followed by at least one digit.

Methods  -

   JSON.parse        -  -> Parse a string as JSON, optionally transform the produced value and its properties, and return the value.
                        -> A valid JSON String should be passed.


   JSON.stringify    -  -> Return a JSON string corresponding to the specified value, optionally including only certain properties or
                           replacing property values in a user-defined manner.
