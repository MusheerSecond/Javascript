JavaScript -   -> JavaScript is a cross-platform, object-oriented scripting language.
               -> It is a small and lightweight language.
               -> Inside a host environment (for example, a web browser), JavaScript can be connected to the objects of its environment to provide programmatic control over them.
               -> JavaScript is the Language which implements a standard called ECMAScript.
               -> There are also other noticeable languages that implement ECMAScript such as ActionScript (used for Flash), JScript (Microsoft).
               -> Each Browser implement their own JavaScript Engine. They implement ECMAScript. (e.g V8 - Google Chrome, SpiderMonkey - Mozilla etc..)


Transpiler -   -> Transpilers, or source-to-source compilers, are tools that read source code written in one programming language, and produce the equivalent code in another language.
               -> Languages you write that transpile to JavaScript are often called compile-to-JS languages, and are said to target JavaScript. (e.g TypeScript and CoffeeScript)
               -> This also transforms NEW JavaScript ES6 to OLD JavaScript ES5. Thus, its possible for writing the next generation of JavaScript today.
               -> BabelJS is the most popular transpiler.

Languages based on          -     -> TypeScript and CoffeeScript, they both provides syntactic sugar for a number of features not yet native to JavaScript, while discouraging some of JavaScript's "bad parts".
JavaScript                        -> They are Built on top of ES5 and then are transcompiled into ES5 compliant JavaScript. (i.e) We write TypeScript or CoffeeScript then the transpiler transforms it into ES5 JavaScript.
                                  -> Anything we can write in JavaScript, we can write in CoffeeScript or TypeScript.



Types of JavaScript         -     -> JavaScript contains a standard library of objects, such as Array, Date, and Math, and
                                     a core set of language elements such as operators, control structures, and statements.
                                  -> Core JavaScript can be extended for a variety of purposes by supplementing it with additional objects; for example:
                                       -> Client-side JavaScript -   -> This extends the core language by supplying objects to control a browser and its Document Object Model (DOM).
                                                                     -> For example, client-side extensions allow an application to place elements on an HTML form and
                                                                        respond to user events such as mouse clicks, form input, and page navigation.
                                       -> Server-side JavaScript -   -> This extends the core language by supplying objects relevant to running JavaScript on a server.
                                                                     -> For example, server-side extensions allow an application to communicate with a database, provide continuity of information
                                                                        from one invocation to another of the application, or perform file manipulations on a server.

Client-Side JavaScript      -     -> JavaScript can be stored either Inline on the Page(Anywhere(i.e Head/Body etc..)) or in an External js File.
Storage                           -> Advantages of External Over Inline JavaScript
                                       -> Maintainability   -        -> External JavaScript can be referenced on Multiple Pages without having to duplicate the Code Inline on Every Page.
                                                                     -> Changes in the File gets reflected on Every Page.
                                       -> Separation of     -        -> Good Practice to Separate HTML, CSS and JS Files as it makes working easier with them.
                                          Concerns
                                       -> Performance       -        -> An External JavaScript can be cached by the Browser, where as an Inline JavaScript on the Page is Loaded Every Time the Page Loads.

                                  Notes :
                                       -> Its a Good Practice to Keep Script Tags in the Bottom, so that the HTML Rendering is Completed as Fast as Possible.
                                       -> Normally, The script is fetched and executed immediately, before the browser continues parsing the page.
                                       -> If async is used, browsers that support it will download that script in the background without blocking the rest of the content on the page(HTML Parser).
                                          The script will execute whenever it is finished downloading.
                                       -> if defer is used, The loading and execution of scripts that are not necessary for the initial page render may be deferred until after the initial render
                                          or other critical parts of the page have finished loading.


Beginning Javascript        -     Data Types -
                                    -> Number
                                    -> boolean
                                    -> String

-> We use "var" keyword to declare all types of Variables.






Disadvantages of JavaScript -
         -> Security        -     -> Since JavaScript runs on the Client Machine, a Malicious user could use JavaScript to do a Variety of things like Tracking Browser History, Stealing Passwords.
         -> Browser         -     -> Not all Browsers treat the Same piece of Javascript in the Same manner.(i.e, The Functionality and User-Interface may vary from Browser to Browser.
            Compatibility            This can be solved using Javascript Libraries like jQuery.
