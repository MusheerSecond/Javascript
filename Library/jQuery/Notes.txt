Notes :
   -> The jQuery function can take Document Object or CSS Selector.(e.g img etc..)
   -> Html Element Ids must be Unique on the Page.
   -> jQuery Id Selector returns only the FIRST Matching Element(rest if present are Ignored).
   -> To check if an Element Exists/Returned by the jQuery Selector, we should use the length property.
   -> A jQuery object wraps the Raw DOM Object and provides jQuery Methods.
   -> To get the underlying DOM Object from a jQuery object, we have to Index that with the Index Position.(i.e) $("#id")[0]
   -> Get(something) is done for the First Matched element and Set is Done for all the Matching Elements in most cases.
   -> According to the DOM specification, any string of text within an element is considered a child node(Text Node) of that element.
   -> $("input") will only return elements with the input tag, whereas $(":input") selects all input, select, textarea and button elements.
   -> Input elements can be Wrapped inside a Label Element to make the Input element to be Selected when we click on its associated Text Content.
      The for attribute of Label, should be given the ID of the associated input Element.
   -> The value Property doesn't reflect the value Attribute, Instead, it's the current value of the input. When the user manually changes
      the value of the input box, the value property will reflect this change. (i.e) The value Attribute is NOT CHANGED When the user changes
      the Value of an Element.(e.g Input Text Element)
   -> The Height and Weight of an Element is Constant, but its Position may Change.
   -> The Difference .data(), .attr() and .prop()
         .attr() - attr() is used to get the value of an attribute of a DOM element which are publicly VISIBLE upon inspection. The attribute
                   can be predefined attributes(e.g id, class) or our own Custom Attributes(e.g data-foo, data-baz-daz etc..)
         .prop() - This is intended for setting valid HTML Element properties, rather than arbitrary data.(e.g class, value etc..). Though, we can have
                   have arbitrary/Custom data set/get using .prop().
         .data() - This is used to Store arbitrary data associated with the matched elements.

         Notes :
            -> If we are passing data to a DOM element from the server, you should set the data on the element.( e.g <a id="foo" data-foo="bar" href="#">foo!</a>)
            -> When you store data on a DOM node in jQuery using data, the variables are stored on the NODE OBJECT. This is to accommodate
               COMPLEX OBJECTS and references as storing the data on the node element as an attribute will only accommodate STRING values.
            -> The .data() method will also perform some basic AUTO-CASTING if the value matches a recognized pattern.
            -> The data can then be accessed using .data() and ALSO using .attr(), since that is an attribute on the element. But, changes made to that Data using .data()
               is reflected only if we get data using the .data().
      -> To use a handler for Multiple Events, use $( selector ).on( "event1 event2 ...", handler );
      -> if document.write is used After the DOM has been Loaded, then it OverWrites the Entire Dom.
      -> When we are Creating Html Elements on the Fly for (e.g. .append, .prepend etc..) along with the String, we can pass in an Object Containing
         the Attributes for Name and its Value to be Inserted for that Element.(e.g. $("<div><div>", {class="someClass"}).appendTo(target);
