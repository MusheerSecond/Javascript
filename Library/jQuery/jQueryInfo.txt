jQuery   -  -> jQuery is a fast, small, and feature-rich JavaScript library. It makes things like HTML document traversal and manipulation,
               event handling, animation, and Ajax much simpler with an easy-to-use API that works across a multitude of browsers.

Advantages of jQuery -  -> It is Cross-Browser.
                        -> It is easier to use than Native JavaScript.
                        -> It is Extensible.
                        -> Simplifies and has Rich AJAX Support.
                        -> It has Large Development Community and Many Plugins.

Notes :
      -> $ is a shortcut for jQuery Object.
      -> jQuery objects maintain an internal STACK that keeps track of changes to the matched set of elements. When one of the DOM traversal methods(e.g add, filter etc..) is called,
         the New SET of elements is pushed onto the stack. (i.e. jQuery Object contains a STACK OF SETS(MATCHED SETS of Elements).
         Thus, jQuery Chaining involves a Single jQuery Object with Current SET of Matched Elements on TOP of the STACK.

CDN                  -  -> Content Delivery Network(CDN) is a System of Distributed Servers that host resources such as Images, CSS, JavaScript Files etc..
                        -> Benefits of Using CDN   -
                              -> Distributed CDN Servers -  -> The jQuery file can be Downloaded from the CDN Server that is Closest to the User.
                              -> Browser Caching         -  -> If a User visits a Web Page that loads jQuery from a CDN Server, the Browser automatically Caches the File,
                                                               Thus, if he visits our website, the jQuery file NEED NOT be download it again.
                              -> Parallel Downloads      -  -> Escapes Parallel Download Restriction on a Domain.
                              -> Reduced Server Load     -  -> No Page Load will make a jQuery File request to our Server.
                        -> Disadvantages                 -  -> Our Client/Users Firewall may block the CDN. So, we may have to request to Whitelist the CDN.
                        Notes :
                           -> In case of any Failure to load jQuery from the CDN, we have to gracefully switch back to loading jQuery from our Server itself.

Additional Notes
   -> function -  -> Receives the index position of the element in the set and the old value(that will be returned by the Outer Function(e.g html() etc..)) / Elements as arguments(index because set is done on all the Set Elements(i.e) Not the First one).
                  -> We can use the old value argument to reference the previous content.
                  -> Within the function, "this" refers to the current element in the set.
                  Declaration
                        Function( Integer index, Element element )

jQuery Functions     -

      -> .extend()   -  -> Merge the contents of two or more objects together into the first object.
                        -> If only one argument is supplied to $.extend(), this means the target argument was omitted. In this case, the jQuery object itself is assumed to be the target. By doing this, you can add new functions to the jQuery namespace.
                           This can be useful for plugin authors wishing to add new methods to JQuery.
                        -> Arguments that are null or undefined are ignored.
                        -> If, however, you want to preserve both of the original objects, you can do so by passing an empty object as the target:
                        -> Properties that are an object constructed via new MyCustomObject(args), or built-in JavaScript types such as Date or RegExp, are not re-constructed and will appear as plain Objects in the resulting object or array.
                        Syntax                                             Returns
                           $.extend(target[, object1][, objectN])          Object
                           $.extend([deep], target, object1[, objectN])    Object

      -> jQuery.inArray()
                        -> Search for a specified value within an array and return its index (or -1 if not found).
                        -> The $.inArray() method is similar to JavaScript's native .indexOf(). But, the comparison between values is strict(!== or ===).
                        Syntax                                             Returns
                           jQuery.inArray( value, array [, fromIndex ] )   Number

      -> .css()      -  -> Get the value of a computed style property for the FIRST element in the set of matched elements or set one or more CSS properties for every matched element.
                        -> This accepts RELATIVE values similar to .animate(). Relative values are a string starting with += or -= to increment or decrement the current value. based on its previous values.
                        Syntax                                 Returns     Notes

                              .css( propertyName )             String
                              .css( propertyNames )            String      propertyNames is an Array of one or more CSS properties.
                           .css( propertyName, value )
                              .css( propertyName, value )      jQuery
                              .css( propertyName, function )   jQuery      A function returning the value to set.
                              .css( properties )               jQuery      properties is an Object containing list of propertyName and Value.

      -> .html()     -  -> Get the HTML contents of the first element in the set of matched elements or set the HTML contents of every matched element.
                        -> This method uses the browser's innerHTML property.
                        -> Additionally, jQuery removes other constructs such as data and event handlers from child elements before replacing those elements with the new content.
                        -> In Internet Explorer up to and including version 9, setting the text content of an HTML element may corrupt the text nodes of its children that are being removed from the document
                           as a result of the operation. If we are keeping references to these DOM elements and need them to be unchanged, use .empty().html( string ) instead of .html(string)
                           so that the elements are removed from the document before the new string is assigned to the element.
                        Syntax                                 Returns     Notes

                           .html( function )                   jQuery      A function returning the HTML content to set.

      -> .attr()     -  -> Get the value of an attribute for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more attributes for every matched element.
                        -> To retrieve and change DOM properties such as the checked, selected, or disabled, selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument,
                           defaultChecked, and defaultSelectedstate of form elements, use the .prop() method.
                        -> The .prop() method provides a way to explicitly retrieve property values, while .attr() retrieves attributes.
                        -> The most important concept to remember about the checked attribute is that it does not correspond to the checked property. The attribute actually corresponds
                           to the defaultChecked property and should be used only to set the initial value of the checkbox. The checked attribute value does not change with the state of the checkbox,
                           while the checked property does.
                        Syntax                                 Returns

                           .attr( attributeName, function )

      -> .removeAttr()  -> Remove an attribute from each element in the set of matched elements.
                        Syntax                                 Returns
                           .removeAttr( attributeName )        jQuery

      -> .val()      -  -> Get the current value of the first element in the set of matched elements or set the value of every matched element.
                        -> This method is primarily used to get the values of FORM ELEMENTS such as input, select and textarea.
                        -> This method returns the VALUE PROPERTY and not the VALUE ATTRIBUTE.
                        -> When the first element in the collection is a select-multiple (i.e., a select element with the multiple attribute set), .val() returns an array
                           containing the value of each selected option.
                        -> This allows us to pass an ARRAY(Not a String) of element values, which is useful when working on a jQuery object containing elements like <input type="checkbox">, <input type="radio">,
                           and <option>s inside of a <select>. If the element value matches with the value we wanted to set, then it is Selected/Checked

                           .val( function )

                        Notes :
                           -> At present, using .val() on <textarea> elements strips carriage return characters from the browser-reported value.
                              When this value is sent to the server via XHR, however, carriage returns are preserved (or added by browsers which do not include them in the raw value).
                              A Work around in specified in the Documentation.
                           -> Setting values using this method (or using the native value property) does not cause the dispatch of the change event. For this reason,
                              the relevant event handlers will not be executed. If you want to execute them, you should call .trigger( "change" ) after setting the value.
                           -> If we pass a String it assigns the Value to the element(except incase of Select where it matches the Existing Values). But, if we pass an ARRAY,
                              this method matches the values of each element with values in the Array, and then Selects/Checks the Elements if present(except incase of input[type=text] elements).

      -> .prop()     -  -> Get the value of a property for the first element in the set of matched elements or set one or more properties for every matched element.
                        -> Elements can have properties such as the checked, selected, or disabled, selectedIndex, tagName, nodeName, nodeType, ownerDocument, defaultChecked, and defaultSelectedstate
                        -> I can have have my own CUSTOM PROPERTIES SET on an Element. (e.g. .prop( "luggageCode", 1234 ) )

      -> .removeProp()  -> Remove a property for the set of matched elements.
                        -> The .removeProp() method removes properties set by the .prop() method.
                        -> Do not use this method to remove native properties such as checked, disabled, or selected. This will remove the property completely and,
                           once removed, cannot be added again to element. Use .prop() to set these properties to false instead.

      -> .text()     -  -> Get the combined text contents of each element in the SET of MATCHED elements, including their Descendants, or set the text contents of the matched elements.
                        -> The .text() method cannot be used on form inputs or scripts. To set or get the text value of input or textarea elements, use the .val() method. To get the value of a script element, use the .html() method.

      -> .each()     -  -> It iterates over the DOM elements that are part of the jQuery object, executing a function for each matched element.
                        -> Most jQuery methods that return a jQuery object also loop through the set of elements in the jQuery collection — a process known as implicit iteration.
                           When this occurs, it is often unnecessary to explicitly iterate with the .each() method:
                        -> We can stop the loop from within the callback function by returning false(NOT undefined or null).

      -> jQuery.each()  -> A generic iterator function, which can be used to seamlessly iterate over both objects and arrays. Arrays and array-like objects with a length property
                           (such as a function's arguments object) are iterated by numeric index, from 0 to length-1. Other objects are iterated via their named properties.
                        -> The $.each() function is not the same as $(selector).each(), which is used to iterate, exclusively, over a jQuery object.
                        -> The $.each() function can be used to iterate over any collection, whether it is an object or an array(but not a jQuery Object).
                        -> The value can also be accessed through the "this" keyword(in each iteration), but Javascript will always wrap the this value as an Object even if it is a simple string or number value.)
                        -> This Also iterates Over the INHERITED PROPERTIES(Normal).
                        -> We can break the $.each() loop at a particular iteration by making the callback function return false. Returning non-false is the same as a continue statement
                           in a for loop; it will skip immediately to the next iteration.

                           jQuery.each( object, callback )     jQuery      Function( String propertyName, Object valueOfProperty ), The function that will be executed on every object.
                        Notes :
                           -> The $.each() function internally retrieves and uses the length property of the passed collection. So, if the collection has a property called length
                              e.g. {bar: 'foo', length: 10} — the function might not work as expected.

                           -> Since positional selectors(such as :first, :gt(), or :even) are jQuery additions and not W3C standard, we recommend using the W3C selectors whenever feasible.

                        Notes :
                           -> When a CSS selector string is passed to .not(), text and comment nodes will always be removed from the resulting jQuery object during the filtering process.
                              When a specific node or array of nodes are provided, text or comment nodes will only be removed from the jQuery object if they match one of the nodes
                              in the filtering array.

      -> .end()      -  -> End the most recent filtering operation in the current chain and return the set of matched elements to its previous state.
                        -> Most of jQuery's DOM traversal methods operate on a jQuery object instance and produce a new one, matching a different set of DOM elements.
                           When this happens, it is as if the New SET of Elements is pushed onto a Stack that is maintained inside the object.
                           Each SUCCESSIVE FILTERING method pushes a New Element "SET" onto the stack.
                           If we need an older element set, we can use end() to pop the sets back off of the stack.
                        -> The end() method is useful primarily when exploiting jQuery's chaining properties.
                        -> A long jQuery chain can be visualized as a structured code block, with filtering methods providing the openings of nested blocks
                           and end() methods closing them.

                        -> If you wish to process a plain array or object, use the jQuery.map() instead.
                        -> As the return value is a jQuery object, which CONTAINS AN ARRAY, it's very common to call .get() on the result to work with a basic array.
                        -> The .map() method is particularly useful for getting or setting the value of a collection of elements.
                        -> The function/callback can return an individual data item or an array of data items(Data can be ANYTHING) to be inserted into the resulting set. If an array is returned,
                           the elements inside the array are inserted into the set. If the function returns null or undefined, no element will be inserted.
                        -> This method is different from .each() in the sense that, .each() is just like a for loop which iterates over the matched set of items(and does some operation using them),
                           whereas .map() is used to RETURN some VALUE(that will be part of the NEW jQuery Object) for every matched element in the set.

                           The jQuery library provides $.makeArray() for such conversions.

                           with an empty set and a length property of 0.
                        -> The Difference between .get() and .eq() is that, .get(0) returns the first DOM element matched by the selector,
                           Whereas, .eq(0) returns a jQuery object containing the first DOM element matched by the selector.

                        -> The .children() method differs from .find() in that .children() only travels a SINGLE LEVEL down the DOM tree while .find() can traverse down multiple levels

                        -> Unlike most of the tree traversal methods, the selector expression is required in a call to .find(). If we need to retrieve all of the descendant elements,
                           we can pass in the universal selector '*' to accomplish this.

      -> .height()   -  -> Get the current computed height for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the height of every matched element.
                        -> The difference between .css( "height" ) and .height() is that the latter returns a unit-less pixel value (for example, 400) while the former returns a value

                        -> The .height() method is recommended when an element's height needs to be used in a mathematical calculation.
                        -> Height Property of an Element "NORMALLY" DOES NOT INCLUDE Padding or Border or Margin of that Element.
                        -> The .height() will always return the content height, regardless of the value of the CSS box-sizing property. To avoid this penalty,

                        Notes :
                           -> The "box-sizing" property is used to tell the browser what the sizing properties (width and height) should include(like padding, border etc..).
                           -> Although style and script tags will report a value for .width() or height() when ABSOLUTELY positioned and given display:block,
                              it is STRONGLY DISCOURAGED to call those methods on these tags. In addition to being a bad practice, the results may also prove unreliable.
                           -> The number returned by dimensions-related APIs, including .height(), may be fractional in some cases. Code should not assume it is an integer.
                              Also, dimensions may be incorrect when the page is zoomed by the user; browsers do not expose an API to detect this condition.
                           -> The value reported by .height() is not guaranteed to be accurate when the element or its parent is hidden. To get an accurate value,
                              ensure the element is visible before using .height(). jQuery will attempt to temporarily show and then re-hide an element in order to measure its dimensions,
                              but this is unreliable and (even when accurate) can significantly impact page performance. This show-and-rehide measurement feature may be removed
                              in a future version of jQuery.

      -> .innerHeight() -> Get the current computed inner height (including padding but not border) for the first element in the set of matched elements or set the inner height
                           of every matched element.
                        -> This method returns the height of the element, including top and bottom padding, in pixels.
                        -> This method is not applicable to window and document objects. For these, use .height() instead.
                        -> When the Inner Height is SET, it is ADJUSTED from the ACTUAL HEIGHT(i.e Padding is not changed).

                        Notes :
                           -> By design, any jQuery constructor or method that accepts an HTML string — jQuery(), .append(), .after(), etc. — can potentially execute code.
                              This can occur by injection of script tags or use of HTML attributes that execute code (for example, <img onload="">). Do not use these methods
                              to insert strings obtained from untrusted sources such as URL query parameters, cookies, or form inputs. Doing so can introduce cross-site-scripting (XSS)
                              vulnerabilities. Remove or escape any user input before adding content to the document.

                           With .after(), the selector expression preceding the method is the container after which the content is inserted. With .insertAfter(), on the other hand,

                        -> When used in conjunction with one of the insertion methods(e.g append, prepend), .clone() is a convenient way to duplicate elements on a page. Since,
                           the Elements will be Otherwise MOVED from their position to the target.

                        Notes :
                           -> For performance reasons, the dynamic state of certain form elements (e.g., user data typed into textarea and user selections made to a select) is
                              not copied to the cloned elements. When cloning input elements, the dynamic state of the element (e.g., user data typed into text inputs and
                              user selections made to a checkbox) is retained in the cloned elements.
                           -> When using the .clone() method, we can modify the cloned elements or their contents before (re-)inserting them into the document.
                           -> Using .clone() has the side-effect of producing elements with duplicate id attributes, which are supposed to be unique. Where possible,
                              it is recommended to avoid cloning elements with this attribute or using class attributes as identifiers instead.

                              the property so that it is safe to use in any browser. The value of which will be 1 for the left button, 2 for the middle button,
                              or 3 for the right button.
                           -> This event is primarily useful for ensuring that the primary button was used to begin a drag operation; if ignored,
                              strange results can occur when the user attempts to use a context menu.
                           -> If the user clicks on an element, drags away from it, and releases the button, this is still counted as a mouseup event.
                              This sequence of actions is treated as a "Canceling" of the button press in most user interfaces, so it is usually better
                              to use the click event unless we know that the mouseup event is preferable for a particular situation.

                              Properties such as .clientX, .offsetX, and .pageX are available, but support for them differs between browsers.
                              Fortunately, jQuery normalizes the .pageX and .pageY properties so that they can be used in all browsers.
                              These properties provide the X and Y coordinates of the mouse pointer relative to the top-left corner of the document.
                           -> Keep in mind that the mousemove event is triggered whenever the mouse pointer moves, even for a pixel.
                              This means that hundreds of events can be generated over a very small amount of time. If the handler has to do
                              any significant processing, or if multiple handlers for the event exist, this can be a serious performance drain
                              on the browser. It is important, therefore, to optimize mousemove handlers as much as possible, and to unbind them
                              as soon as they are no longer needed.
                           -> A common pattern is to bind the mousemove handler from within a mousedown hander, and to unbind it from a
                              corresponding mouseup handler. If implementing this sequence of events, remember that the mouseup event might be sent
                              to a different HTML element than the mousemove event was. To account for this, the mouseup handler should typically
                              be bound to an element high up in the DOM tree, such as <body>.

                        Notes :
                           -> It is inadvisable to bind handlers to both the click and dblclick events for the same element. The sequence of events triggered
                              varies from browser to browser, with some receiving two click events before the dblclick and others only one.
                              Double-click sensitivity (maximum time between clicks that is detected as a double click) can vary by operating system and browser,
                              and is often user-configurable.

      -> .contextmenu() -> Bind an event handler to the "contextmenu" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> The contextmenu event is sent to an element when the right button of the mouse is clicked on it, but before the context menu is displayed.
                           In case the context menu key is pressed, the event is triggered on the html element.

      -> .change()   -  -> Bind an event handler to the "change" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> This method is a shortcut for .on( "change", handler ) in the first two variations, and .trigger( "change" ) in the third.
                        -> The change event is sent to an element when its value changes. This event is limited to <input> elements, <textarea> boxes and <select> elements.
                        -> For select boxes, checkboxes, and radio buttons, the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse, but for the other element types
                           the event is deferred until the element loses focus.
                        -> To trigger the event manually, apply .change() without arguments.
                        -> Changing the value of an input element using JavaScript, using .val() for example, won't fire the event.

      -> .keydown()  -  -> Bind an event handler to the "keydown" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> The keydown event is sent to an element when the user presses a key on the keyboard. If the key is kept pressed, the event is sent every time the operating system

                        -> It can be attached to any element, but the event is only sent to the element that has the focus. Focusable elements can vary between browsers, but form elements
                           can always get focus so are reasonable candidates for this event type.
                        -> For catching actual text entry, .keypress() may be a better choice.

                        Notes :
                           -> If key presses anywhere need to be caught (for example, to implement global shortcut keys on a page), it is useful to attach this behavior to the document object.
                              Because of event bubbling, all key presses will make their way up the DOM to the document object unless explicitly stopped.
                           -> To determine which key was pressed, examine the event object that is passed to the handler function. While browsers use differing properties to store this information,
                              jQuery normalizes the .which property so you can reliably use it to retrieve the key code.

      -> .keyup()    -  -> Bind an event handler to the "keyup" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.

      -> .keypress() -  -> Bind an event handler to the "keypress" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> The keypress event is sent to an element when the browser registers keyboard input. This is similar to the keydown event, except that modifier and non-printing keys such as
                           Shift, Esc, and delete trigger keydown events but NOT keypress events.

                           The user could have clicked on a link to leave the page, or typed in a new URL in the address bar. The forward and back buttons will trigger the event. Closing the browser window
                           will cause the event to be triggered. Even a page reload will first create an unload event.

                           -> Most browsers will ignore calls to alert(), confirm() and prompt() inside the event handler. The string we return may be used in a confirmation dialog, but not all browsers support this.
                              It is not possible to cancel the unload event with .preventDefault().

      -> .error()    -  -> Bind an event handler to the "error" JavaScript event.

                           -> The error event on the window object uses nonstandard arguments and return value conventions, so it is not supported by jQuery.

      -> .resize()   -  -> Bind an event handler to the "resize" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.
                        -> The resize event is sent to the "window" element when the size of the browser window changes:

                              (the typical behavior in Internet Explorer and WebKit-based browsers such as Safari and Chrome), or only once at the end of the resize operation
                              (the typical behavior in some other browsers such as Opera).

      -> .scroll()   -  -> Bind an event handler to the "scroll" JavaScript event, or trigger that event on an element.

                        -> When writing code that will be used as a plugin, or simply when working with a large code base, best practice is to attach and remove events using namespaces so that the code
                           will not inadvertently remove event handlers attached by other code.
                        -> At minimum, either a namespace or event name must be provided.
                        -> To remove specific delegated event handlers, provide a selector argument. The selector string must exactly match the one passed to .on() when the event handler was attached.
                           To remove all delegated events from an element without removing non-delegated events, use the special value "**".

                        -> The .one() method is identical to .on(), except that the handler for a given element and event type is unbound after its first invocation

                        -> The event object is always passed as the first parameter to an event handler. An array of arguments can also be passed to the .trigger() call, and these parameters will be passed
                           along to the handler as well following the event object(Second Third param etc..). As of jQuery 1.6.2, single string or numeric argument can be passed without being wrapped in an array.
                        -> Note the difference between the extra parameters passed here and the eventData parameter to the .on() method. Both are mechanisms for passing information to an event handler,
                           but the extraParameters argument to .trigger() allows information to be determined AT THE TIME the event is triggered, while the eventData argument to .on() requires
                           the information to be already computed at the time the handler is bound.

                        Notes :
                           -> When triggering with a plain object that is not array-like but still contains a length property, you should pass the object in an array (e.g. [ { length: 1 } ]).
                           -> To pass arbitrary data through an event object:
                                 var event = jQuery.Event( "logged" );
                                 event.user = "foo";

                                 $( "body" ).trigger( event );
                           -> For both plain objects and DOM objects other than window, if a triggered event name matches the name of a property on the object, jQuery will attempt to invoke(by default) the property as a method
                              if no event handler calls event.preventDefault(). If this behavior is not desired, use .triggerHandler() instead.

      -> .triggerHandler()
                        -> Execute all handlers attached to an element for an event.
                        -> It will also execute(by default) any method called on{eventType}() (PropertyName) found on the element.
                        -> The behavior of this method is similar to .trigger(), with the following exceptions:
                              -> The .triggerHandler( "event" ) method will not call .event() on the element it is triggered on. This means .triggerHandler( "submit" ) on a form will not call .submit() on the form.
                              -> While .trigger() will operate on all elements matched by the jQuery object, .triggerHandler() only affects the first matched element.
                              -> Events triggered with .triggerHandler() do not bubble up the DOM hierarchy; if they are not handled by the target element directly, they do nothing.
                              -> Instead of returning the jQuery object (to allow chaining), .triggerHandler() returns whatever value was returned by the last handler it caused to be executed.
                                 If no handlers are triggered, it returns undefined

      -> jQuery.proxy() -> Takes a function and returns a new one that will always have a particular context.
                        -> This method is most useful for attaching event handlers to an element where the context is pointing back to a different object.
                        -> when the context is null or undefined the proxied function will be called with the same this object as the proxy was called with.
                           This allows $.proxy() to be used to partially apply the arguments of a function Without changing the context.

                        -> The .fadeToggle() method animates the opacity of the matched elements. When called on a visible element, the element's display style property is set to none
                           once the opacity reaches 0, so the element no longer affects the layout of the page.

                           .fadeToggle([duration][, easing][, complete ])  jQuery      complete - A function to call once the animation is complete, called once per matched element.

      -> .queue()    -  -> Show the queue of functions to be executed on the matched elements or Manipulate the queue of functions to be executed, once for each matched element.
                        -> Queues allow a sequence of actions to be called on an element asynchronously, without halting program execution. The typical example of this is
                           calling multiple animation methods(chaining) on an element.
                        -> Also, a Queue of actions for one Element DOES NOT STOP a Queue of Actions of Another Element from Executing.
                        -> The functions/Operations in the Queue are executed the same way a Normal Queue works.(i.e One after the Other)
                        -> Every Element can have one to many queues of functions attached to it by jQuery. In most applications, only one queue (called fx) is used.
                           Thus, every Element has its OWN fx Queue to handle a sequence of actions chained together.
                        -> Calling .queue() with a callback is useful, as it allows us to place a new function at the end of the queue(Not to the Very End, but to the Current End of the Queue).
                           The callback function is executed once for each element in the jQuery set. This feature is similar to providing a callback function with an animation method,
                           but does not require the callback to be given at the time the animation is performed.
                        -> If we want the call to some actions(animations) to be executed in parallel(not as in Queue), then set queue option as false for that particular action(animations method).

                        Notes :
                           -> When adding a function with .queue(), we should ensure that .dequeue() is eventually called so that the next function in line dequeued/executed.
                              The function that's called is passed another function as the first argument. When called, this automatically dequeues the next item and keeps the queue moving.
                           -> The length property of jQuery object from .queue() also includes the Currently Executing action(present as "inprogress" in the queue) in the count(i.e. not just those in the Queue).
                           -> NO-arguments forms of .show() or .hide() DO NOT use the effects queue(fx queue).

      -> .dequeue()  -  -> Execute the next function on the queue for the matched elements.
                        -> When .dequeue() is called, the next function on the queue is removed from the queue, and then executed. This function should in turn (directly or indirectly) cause .dequeue() to be called,
                           so that the sequence can continue.

                        -> When used without an argument, .clearQueue() removes the remaining functions from fx, the standard effects queue.
                        -> In this way it is similar to .stop(true). However, while the .stop() method is meant to be used only with animations, .clearQueue() can also be used
                           to remove any function that has been added to a generic jQuery queue with the .queue() method.

                        -> If the jumpToEnd argument is provided with a value of true, the current animation stops, but the CURRENT element is immediately given its target values for each CSS property.
                        -> Stopping a toggled animation prematurely with .stop() will trigger jQuery's internal effects tracking. (i.e. Subsequent toggle actions will start from its initial position(NOT at a new "half-way" state due to premature Stopping]).
                        -> We can create a nice fade effect without the common problem of multiple queued animations by adding .stop(true, true) to the chain:
                           e.g. $( "#hoverme-stop-2" ).hover(function() {

      -> .finish()   -  -> When .finish() is called on an element, the currently-running animation and all queued animations (if any) immediately stop and their CSS properties set to their target values.
                           All queued animations are removed.
                        -> The .finish() method is similar to .stop(true, true) in that it clears the queue and the current animation jumps to its end value. It differs, however, in that .finish() also
                            causes the CSS property of ALL queued animations to jump to their end values, as well.

                        -> The .delay() method is best for delaying between queued jQuery effects. Because it is limited and it doesn't, for example, offer a way to cancel the delay.
                        -> Only subsequent events in a queue are delayed. For example this will not delay the no-arguments forms of .show() or .hide() which do not use the effects queue.

                        Notes :
                           -> .delay() is not a replacement for JavaScript's native setTimeout function, which may be more appropriate for certain use cases.

      -> .animate()  -  -> Perform a custom animation of a set of CSS properties.
                        -> The .animate() method allows us to create animation effects on any NUMERIC CSS property. The only required parameter is a plain object of CSS properties.
                           This object is similar to the one that can be sent to the .css() method, except that the range of properties is more restrictive.
                        -> In addition to numeric values, each property can take the strings 'show', 'hide', and 'toggle'.  In order to use jQuery's built-in toggle state tracking, the 'toggle' keyword
                           must be Consistently given as the value of the property being animated.(e.g height: "toggle")
                        -> The callback is executed ONCE per matched element, not once for the animation as a whole. Use the .promise() method to obtain a promise to which you can attach callbacks
                           that fire once for an animated set of any size, including zero elements.

                           -> Most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jQuery functionality.
                           -> Shorthand CSS properties (e.g. font, background, border) are not fully supported(i.e. 'font' instead of 'font-size' is Not Supported.)
                           -> Unlike shorthand animation methods such as .slideDown() and .fadeIn(), the .animate() method does not make hidden elements visible
                              as part of the effect(effects such as Changing Element height, width etc does not show the Element if already Hidden).
                           -> Directional properties (top, right, bottom, left) have no discernible effect on elements if their  position style property is "static", which it is by default.
